This includes students who either are determined eligible for work-study, or have an Expected Family Contribution of $0 in the current academic year - rules will continue until 30 days after the COVID-19 Public Health emergency is lifted
  * The maximum allotments for food assistance were increased by 15% - approved by congress, and will continue through June 30, 2021
  * Clients considered "Able-Bodied Adults Without Dependents" in all counties, including King County, will be temporarily granted good cause to not be terminated for non-participation due to the Governor’s Safe Start proclamation, which limit available activities.

  * DSHS conducts a TANF Teen Living Assessment, which may include a home visit for all unmarried, minor parents applying for TANF cash assistance, to determine eligibility and offer support to the household. The home visits are suspended until further notice.

  * ORR has waived the 90-day requirement for completing the Refugee Health Screening. ORIA requests that contracted RHS providers notify ORIA and DOH directly about any post-90-day refugee health screenings.
  * For clients participating in certain ORR-funded programs, the 60-month eligibility limitation is waived through April 30, 2021. Clients are eligible beyond five years, as long as they have not naturalized.
