The term "Coast Salish Tribes" refers to tribes and bands that inhabited the region from the coast of what is present-day British Columbia, down to Lower Chehalis; inland along the Skagit and Fraser Rivers; along the Juan de Fuca Strait, Strait of Georgia, and Straits Salish; and surrounding the Puget Sound. These tribes also shared an overarching Central Salishan linguistic family, branching off into Lushootseed, Straits Salish (further into Klallam, and more), Twana, et cetera.
