======SnoCo's Two Public Library Systems======



There are two local library systems in Snohomish County. "Everett Public Library" and "Sno-Isle Libraries". 

Everett Public Library has two branches in the City of Everett specifically. Every other city in the county relies on Sno-Isle Libraries, which has 23 libraries spread throughout Snohomish County and Island County as their name implies.

====With that, here are some reasons to go to the library besides borrowing books.====
     *Borrow movies and TV shows in physical formats as well as audio CDs \\
     *Reserve rooms for studying, club meetings, and other uses \\ 
     *Meet new people \\
     *Internet access \\
     *Tax help \\
     *Free classes
     *Community resource information \\
     *Printers for public use \\
     *Register to vote \\

And more!\\

Seriously. If you don't have a library card, get one if you can. It's not like you have to buy it. We all pay for the libraries through taxes anyway! ;)
