======Understanding the Oppressed======

Here is the all-in-one place for links to pages if you're still learning about different oppressed groups. 

There are gay white men that are racist. There are cis black men that are transphobic. White women have excluded black women from their feminist spaces. There are different forms of oppression we of the "marginalized" face and we believe it's important we recognize we can oppress each other. Recognizing intersectionality is very important to us and so we think of this page as a resource to help us understand EACH OTHER as well. 

====BIPOC====

//Black, Indigenous, and People of Color//

====Immigrants====

Immigrants to the US and other countries presently face and historically suffered a type of oppression called 'xenophobia' (also connected to racism and nativism).

//"Pronounced zeen-oh-fobe-ee-ah, xenophobia is the fear or contempt of foreign people, places or things. People with this “fear” are known as xenophobes and the attitudes they have as xenophobic. [...] their “fear” can best be compared to homophobia, as hatred largely drives their repulsion to foreigners. As a result of xenophobia, immigrants [...] face[] discrimination in employment, housing, and other sectors."//((Journal: ThoughtCo. Language: English (U.S.). Author: Nittle, Nadra Kareem.

====Religious Oppression====

While there are many marginalized groups that can face religious oppression when there is any dominant religion (even if a government is not, itself, religious), two religious groups in particular have faced significant oppression, both historically and currently. The discrimination against these religious groups has become inextricably bound up with racism.

//"Islamophobia is a type of racism that targets expressions of Muslimness or perceived Muslimness."//((Journal: Critical Muslim Studies. Language: English (U.K.). Author: Critical Muslim Studies.

//"“Anti-Semitism” has been accepted and understood to mean hatred of the Jewish people.
