  * WHEREAS, the Washington State legislature subsequently enacted statutes designed to implement the public agency provisions of the NVRA which are codified at RCW 29A.08.310 through RCW 29A.08.360; and

    * If you were convicted of a felony in a Washington State court, your right to vote is restored automatically once you are no longer under the authority of DOC (in prison or on community custody). If you have questions about your status with DOC, call at (800) 430-9674.
    * If you were convicted of a felony in another state or in federal court, your right to vote is restored automatically as long as you are not currently incarcerated for that felony.

    * You do not need a certificate of discharge (COD) to have your voting rights restored.
    * You are not required to completely pay off your fines, restitution, or other legal financial obligations (LFOs) before you register to vote. However, your voting rights can be revoked if the sentencing court determines that you have failed to comply with the terms of your legal financial obligations.
    * Only people in jail, prison, or on community custody under Department of Corrections (DOC) authority for a felony conviction are not eligible to vote.
    * Once your right to vote is restored, you must register to vote if you want to vote. If you were previously registered to vote, you must re-register to vote.
